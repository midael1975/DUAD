Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit behaviors from more than one base class. This is used when an object needs to combine capabilities from different sources.

Common Uses
1. Mixing Behaviors (Mixins)
This is the most common and safe use.

A mixin is a small class that adds a specific ability, for example:

• Making an object serializable
• Adding logging capabilities
• Adding validations
• Adding utility methods
Mixins don't represent "things," but rather abilities.

2. Combining Roles
A class can represent two roles simultaneously.

Example: an object can be both an Employee and a System User.

3. Multiple Specialization
When a class needs to behave as two different types at the same time.

4. Integrating Functionalities from Different Hierarchies
Useful when two classes are unrelated, but their methods are needed in a final class.
